## 📖 Project Overview

TripSync is a full-stack collaborative trip-planning platform where groups can plan travel together in real time. Instead of scattered group chats, email threads, and spreadsheets, TripSync gives every trip a shared workspace: a destination itinerary, a live expense ledger, file storage for tickets and bookings, and role-based member management — all updating instantly across every open browser tab via WebSockets.

> This is a personal / portfolio project, built solo to demonstrate full-stack development skills: real-time features, JWT auth with token rotation, RBAC, file uploads, and modern React patterns. Try it live at [tripsync.piyushdev.online](https://tripsync.piyushdev.online/).

### Module pattern (Backend)

Every feature follows the same four-layer structure:

```
src/modules/<feature>/
  ├── <feature>.routes.js      # Express router + middleware chain
  ├── <feature>.controller.js  # Thin — reads req, calls service, sends res
  ├── <feature>.service.js     # Business logic + DB queries + socket emits
  ├── <feature>.model.js       # Mongoose schema
  └── dto/                     # Joi validation schemas

## 🗄 Database Design

```
Users
  _id, fullName, email, password (bcrypt), isVerified
  refreshToken (hashed), verificationToken, resetPasswordToken, resetPasswordTokenExpires

Trips
  _id, title, description, owner → Users, startDate, endDate, coverImage

TripMembers
  _id, tripId → Trips, userId → Users, role (Owner | Editor | Viewer)

Destinations
  _id, tripId → Trips, name, description, visitDate, visitTime, estimatedCost, createdBy → Users

Expenses
  _id, tripId → Trips, title, amount, shareAmount, category, paidBy → Users, note

Documents
  _id, tripId → Trips, name, url, publicId, uploadedBy → Users
```

**Key design decisions:**

- `refreshToken` is stored hashed (SHA-256) in the DB — a stolen token is useless without the raw value
- `shareAmount = amount / memberCount` is pre-computed on write for O(1) balance reads
- `TripMembers` is a separate collection (not embedded) so membership queries are index-friendly

---

## ⚡ Real-time Collaboration (Socket.IO)

Every trip gets its own Socket.IO room: `trip_<tripId>`. Members join when they open a trip page and automatically rejoin after reconnections.

### Auth flow

```
Client connects with { auth: { token: "Bearer <jwt>" } }
       │
io.use(socketAuth)  ──► verifyAccessToken() ──► User.findById()
       │                      ✓                       ✓
       └──► socket.data.user = { id, fullName, email }
            Connection accepted
```

### Events

| Event                 | Emitted after         | Received by              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `expense:created`     | New expense saved     | All members in trip room |
| `expense:updated`     | Expense updated       | All members in trip room |
| `expense:deleted`     | Expense deleted       | All members in trip room |
| `destination:created` | New destination saved | All members in trip room |
| `destination:updated` | Destination updated   | All members in trip room |
| `destination:deleted` | Destination deleted   | All members in trip room |
| `member:added`        | Member added          | All members in trip room |
| `member:updated`      | Role changed          | All members in trip room |
| `member:deleted`      | Member removed        | All members in trip room |
| `document:uploaded`   | File uploaded         | All members in trip room |
| `document:deleted`    | File deleted          | All members in trip room |

### Frontend handling

```js
// useTripSocket.js — joins room, registers listeners, cleans up on unmount
socket.emit("join-trip", tripId);
socket.on("connect", () => socket.emit("join-trip", tripId)); // handles reconnects

socket.on("expense:created", () =>
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["expenses", tripId] })
);
// ... same pattern for all 11 events
```

| `POST` | `/auth/login`                 | —      | Login, returns access token + sets refresh cookie |
| `POST` | `/auth/refresh-token`         | Cookie | Silently rotate tokens                            |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout`                | Bearer | Invalidate refresh token                          |
| `POST` | `/auth/forgot-password`       | —      | Send reset email                                  |

| `GET`  | `/auth/me`                    | Bearer | Get current user                                  |

### Trips

| Method   | Endpoint               | Role          | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------- |

| `GET`    | `/trips/getAllTrips`   | Any           | Get all trips for current user |
| `PATCH`  | `/trips/:tripId`       | Owner, Editor | Update trip details            |
| `DELETE` | `/trips/:tripId`       | Owner         | Delete trip                    |

| `DELETE` | `/trips/:tripId/expenses/:id`      | Owner         | Delete expense          |

> Members, Destinations, and Documents follow the same RESTful pattern under `/trips/:tripId/`.

### RBAC Middleware

```js
// Middleware chain applied per route
authenticate          // verifies JWT, attaches req.user
loadTripRole         // looks up TripMember record, attaches req.tripRole
requireRole("Owner") // throws 403 if role is insufficient
```

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

**React StrictMode + Socket.IO**
StrictMode double-invokes effects in development, creating two socket connections and causing the first one to be cleaned up before it connected — meaning `setSocket` was never called and the context stayed `null`. Fixed by wrapping `setSocket` in the socket's `connect` event with an `active` flag to guard against the StrictMode cleanup cycle.

**Token refresh race condition**
Multiple simultaneous API requests expiring at the same time all triggered refresh simultaneously, causing one to succeed and the rest to fail with "invalid token" (because the refresh token had already rotated). Fixed with an `isRefreshing` flag and a `failedQueue` in the Axios interceptor that queues all subsequent 401s and retries them with the new token once the refresh completes.

**Socket room auth after reconnect**
When a socket disconnects and reconnects (new socket ID on server), it loses room membership. Without rejoining, events were silently dropped. Fixed by listening to the socket's `connect` event inside `useTripSocket` and re-emitting `join-trip` on every (re)connection.

**RBAC at route level**
Implemented a two-step middleware approach: `loadTripRole` first fetches the member record and attaches `req.tripRole`, then `requireRole(...allowed)` checks it. This keeps route files declarative and avoids repeated DB lookups inside controllers.
